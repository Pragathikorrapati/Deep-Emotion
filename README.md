# ðŸ§  Deep Emotion

**Deep Emotion** is a deep learning-based emotion classification system that analyzes textual input and predicts human emotions such as **joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, **fear**, **love**, and **surprise**. It leverages a **Bidirectional LSTM** with an **Attention Mechanism** and uses **GloVe embeddings** for semantic understanding. The model is deployed through a **Streamlit** web application, allowing real-time emotion prediction from user input.
